# MediGuard AI – An Interactive Drug Interaction and Side Effect Predictor using LLMs with RAG-based Chat Assistance

## Overview
Polypharmacy—the simultaneous use of multiple medications—significantly increases the risk of adverse drug interactions, potentially leading to severe side effects or reduced therapeutic effectiveness. Traditional drug interaction detection systems rely on static databases that struggle to adapt to newly introduced medications or complex interaction patterns.

**MediGuard AI** addresses this challenge by leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** fine-tuned on extensive medical datasets such as **DrugBank** and **SIDER**. This system provides real-time alerts, risk scores, and safer medication alternatives using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chat assistance** to enhance user interaction and decision-making.

## Key Features
- **AI-driven Drug Interaction Detection**: Uses fine-tuned LLMs to analyze and predict drug interactions.
- **RAG-based Chat Assistance**: Enhances response accuracy by retrieving relevant medical data before generating context-aware insights.
- **Real-time Alerts and Risk Scores**: Instantly warns users about potential adverse effects.
- **Personalized Predictions**: Factors in patient-specific data such as age, medical history, and prescriptions.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed for healthcare professionals and patients to access critical drug safety information efficiently.

## Project Significance
This project is **one of our final-year research endeavors**, developed by **Masruk Habib** and **Puvanenthria Raja**. Through **MediGuard AI**, we gained hands-on experience with **LLMs, Generative AI, and RAG-based architectures**, deepening our understanding of AI-driven solutions in healthcare. Our work emphasizes how AI can **revolutionize drug safety** by continuously adapting to new medical knowledge and offering personalized healthcare insights.

## Limitations & Future Scope
- **Limitations**:
  - Dependence on the quality and recency of training datasets.
  - Requires continuous updates to stay aligned with emerging medications and drug interactions.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Expansion to support multilingual drug interaction queries.
  - Integration with electronic health records (EHR) for deeper personalization.
  - Deployment as a mobile and web-based platform for wider accessibility.

## Conclusion
**MediGuard AI** is a step toward safer medication use by **combining AI-driven predictions with an interactive, RAG-enhanced chat assistant**. By enabling healthcare professionals and patients to make informed decisions, we aim to reduce medication errors and improve patient safety in real-time.
