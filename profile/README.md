# MediGuard AI â€“ An Interactive Drug Interaction and Side Effect Predictor using LLMs with RAG-based Chat Assistance

MediGuard AI is an advanced AI-driven drug interaction and side effect predictor that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on medical datasets like DrugBank and SIDER. Unlike traditional static systems, MediGuard AI uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chat assistance to provide real-time alerts, risk scores, and safer medication alternatives.

This project, developed by Masruk Habib and Puvanenthria Raja as part of our final-year research, allowed us to explore LLMs, Generative AI, and RAG architectures. MediGuard AI personalizes drug interaction insights by considering patient-specific factors such as age, medical history, and prescriptions, enhancing safety and informed decision-making for healthcare providers.

By continuously adapting to new medical knowledge, MediGuard AI aims to revolutionize drug safety, making medication management smarter, safer, and more efficient. ðŸš€
